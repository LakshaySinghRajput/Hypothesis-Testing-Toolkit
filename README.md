# Hypothesis-Testing-Toolkit
 Hypothesis testing techniques for analyzing data and validating relationships. It includes practical examples, visualizations, and concise explanations to demonstrate the application of statistical tests for informed decision-making.

This repository demonstrates the application of **Hypothesis Testing** using Python, focusing on the following statistical tests: **Z-Test**, **T-Test**, **ANOVA**, and **Chi-Square Test**. It includes solutions to multiple scenarios, validations, and visualizations to explain the decision-making process.  

## Purpose of the Repository  
- Showcase the practical use of hypothesis tests in validating assumptions and analyzing data.
- Provide a clear understanding of when and where to apply these tests in data analysis workflows.
- Visualize the results of statistical tests for better interpretation and presentation.  

## Tests Included  
1. **Z-Test**  
   - Used to determine if there is a significant difference between sample and population means.  
   - Applied for large sample sizes with known population variance.  

2. **T-Test**  
   - Assesses whether the means of two groups are significantly different.  
   - Suitable for small sample sizes or unknown population variance.  

3. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**  
   - Tests differences between the means of three or more groups.  
   - Helps identify significant variations across multiple categories.  

4. **Chi-Square Test**  
   - Evaluates the independence of categorical variables.  
   - Useful in analyzing contingency tables and checking relationships between variables.  

## Key Features  
- Implementation of hypothesis testing with real-world datasets.  
- Detailed explanation of how each test was performed and interpreted.  
- **Validation Insights**: Explains the acceptance or rejection of null hypotheses based on p-values and significance levels (Î± = 0.05).  
- Visualizations (e.g., bar plots, box plots) to support and present findings effectively.  

## Applications  
- **Data Validation**: Ensuring assumptions hold true before building models.  
- **API Validation**: Testing real-time data pipelines for consistency and correctness.  
- **Decision Support**: Backing business or research decisions with statistical evidence.
